# NoApp-Filter
### Another filter that aiming to remove any annoyance that suggest (or force) users to open in app instead of staying in browser.
#### Unfortunately, this filter required to use with Firefox-based browser for android only (e.g. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/android/), [Fennec F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid), [IceCatMobile](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.gnu.icecat), [Pale Moon](http://www.palemoon.org/palemoon-android.shtml)) because currently it have few browsers that support add-ons (that also can install ad-blocking addons into your browser.)

For a sake of privacy that many sites want (or force) visitors to use their app instead of staying in (mobile) web browser, e.g. when you use `Facebook` or `Twitter` on mobile browser and open external sites, some external sites also have or created their app and show a notice to visitor who still use mobile browser to use their app instead.

but main problem is when you switch to open in app, you are unable to control what data and sites should be loaded because some apps their make was hard-coded to include library of showing advertisement, data analytics and ability to have report your usage data back to their site without notice.

This filter will be eliminate any notice, banner or something else that suggest (or force) you to use those app and feel free to say in your mobile browser as long as you can.
